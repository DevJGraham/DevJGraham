# Hi, I'm David Graham

🔬 **Returning Research Intern** – Mayo Clinic Emergency Department (Summer 2025) 

🎓 **Computer Science Student** at Western Governors University 

📍 Based in Pittsburgh, PA  
 
---

I'm passionate about combining the structure of computer science with the messiness of real-world data to build solutions that are both impactful and practical. My interests lie in **machine learning**, **predictive modeling**, and **data-driven problem solving**—especially in the healthcare, real estate, and business domains.

I recently completed a **Data Science & Machine Learning internship at the Mayo Clinic**, where I worked on predictive modeling for clinical outcomes using tools like Python, Scikit-learn, SHAP, and XGBoost. I will be returning for another research internship in the same department for the summer of 2025. Outside of formal work, I build tools like web scrapers and fine-tune transformer models for text classification—always aiming to learn something new and solve problems in meaningful ways.

## 📌 Notable Projects

- **🚑 Healthcare Prediction (Mayo Clinic)**  
  Built XGBoost models for behavioral health disposition prediction and anaphylaxis risk prediction from EMR data; applied SHAP for model interpretation and SMOTE for class balancing.

- **🏘️ Real Estate Data Scraper**  
  Asynchronous web scraper using `aiohttp`, `Selenium`, and `BeautifulSoup` to gather real-time data from county records for property analysis.

- **🤗 Pedestrian Injury Classification with DistilBERT**  
  Fine-tuning a transformer model using Hugging Face and LoRA for classifying injury reports, aiming to automate cohort discovery in medical datasets.
